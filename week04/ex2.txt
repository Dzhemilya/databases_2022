### Dzhemilya Gizutdinova Lab 4, Task 2

### 1. Π𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 ( Π𝑠𝑖𝑑 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 = 𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑠 ⋈ 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 < 100 𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔 ⋈ 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟𝑠 )

- #### First query computes names (of one <u>**and**</u> several suppliers) of suppliers who sell red parts with cost which is less than $ 100.

### 2. ( Π𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 = 𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑠 ⋈ 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 < 100 𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔 ⋈ 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟𝑠 ) ) ∩ ( Π𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 ( ( 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 = 𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑠 ) ⋈      ( 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 < 100 𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔 ) ⋈ 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟𝑠 ) )

- #### Second query computes names (of one and several suppliers) of suppliers who sell both some red parts & some green parts with cost which is less than $ 100.

### 3. ( Π𝑠𝑖𝑑 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 = 𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑠 ⋈ 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 < 100 𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔 ⋈ 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟𝑠 ) ∩ ( Π𝑠𝑖𝑑 ( ( 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 = 𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑠 ) ⋈ ( 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 < 100 𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔 ⋈ 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟𝑠 ) )

- #### Third query computes SID (of one supplier) who sell both some red and some green parts with cost which is less than $ 100.

### 4. Π𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒( ( Π𝑠𝑖𝑑, 𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 ( ( 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 = 𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑠 ) ⋈ ( 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 < 100 𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔 ) ⋈ 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟𝑠 ) ) ∩ ( Π𝑠𝑖𝑑,𝑠𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒 ( ( 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑟 = 𝑔𝑟𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑃𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑠 ) ⋈ ( 𝜎 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 < 100 𝐶𝑎𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑜𝑔 ) ⋈ 𝑆𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑟𝑠 ) ) )

- #### Fourth query computes names (of one supplier) of suppliers who sell both some red and some green parts with cost which is less than $ 100.
